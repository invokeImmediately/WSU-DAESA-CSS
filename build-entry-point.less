/** ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*** ADDITIONAL DESIGN COMMENTS
*** ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
*** DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: This stylesheet mixes semantic with functional CSS. The Spine Theme for WSUWP
***   takes a semantic approach to styling; thus, this add-on style sheet necessarily contains some
***   semantic styling of its own. Specifically, semantic CSS is utilized to override or minimally
***   build upon the default design imposed by the Spine Builder theme.
***
***   Functional CSS is utilized to maximally build upon the Spine builder theme by further
***   extending its design flexibility. Content authors are enabled more options for tweaking the
***   basal design to suit their needs without needing to touch CSS, while the CSS is made more
***   reusable and easier to maintain.
***
*** ORGANIZATION OF STYLESHEET: This stylesheet is organized such that semantic CSS precedes
***   functional CSS. This is done to ensure that utility classes associated with functional CSS
***   override all other behaviors.
***
***   The semantic styling section of this stylesheet is laid out according to the W3C HTML5
***   language specification (please see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ for more information). Style
***   rules are generally declared in the same sequence as their matching elements appear in the
***   HTML5 spec. Moreover, property settings are generally made in alphabetical order within a
***   declaration to make the code more predictable an thereby easier to read.
