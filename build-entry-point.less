/** ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  ADDITIONAL DESIGN COMMENTS
 *  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: This stylesheet mixes semantic with functional CSS. The Spine Theme for WSUWP
 *    takes a semantic approach to styling; thus, this add-on style sheet necessarily contains some
 *    semantic styling of its own. Specifically, semantic CSS is utilized to override or minimally
 *    build upon the default design imposed by the Spine Builder theme.
 *
 *    Functional CSS is utilized to maximally build upon the Spine builder theme by further
 *    extending its design flexibility. Content authors are enabled more options for tweaking the
 *    basal design to suit their needs without needing to touch CSS, while the CSS is made more
 *    reusable and easier to maintain.
 *
 *  ORGANIZATION OF STYLESHEET: This stylesheet is organized such that semantic CSS precedes
 *    functional CSS. This is done to ensure that utility classes associated with functional CSS
 *    override all other behaviors.
 *
 *    The semantic styling section of this stylesheet is laid out according to the W3C HTML5
 *    language specification (please see https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ for more information). Style
 *    rules are generally declared in the same sequence as their matching elements appear in the
 *    HTML5 spec. Moreover, property settings are generally made in alphabetical order within a
 *    declaration to make the code more predictable an thereby easier to read.
