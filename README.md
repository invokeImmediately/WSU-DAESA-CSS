# WSU-UE---CSS
This repository contains precompiled CSS, written in the [Less language](http://lesscss.org/features/), for defining styles common to all WordPress websites of the [WSU Office of Undergraduate Education (OUE)](https://vpue.wsu.edu). It is designed to be included as a git submodule on repositories dedicated to the development of a particular OUE website. Moreover, the CSS compiled from this repository is meant to be applied as add-on CSS in the [WSU WordPress spine parent theme](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/WSUWP-spine-parent-theme).
